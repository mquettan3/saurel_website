I'm not sure that I like the whole "Layout" class.  Feels really restricting.  I'd rather have pages and each page be their own top level then import each component.  The problem with layout is that I don't want every page to have the same layout (Specifically not sure where I want to put the container.)

layout.css needs to be deleted - Anything that's needed in there should be in main.scss or a new sass file.  Maybe I should just include a normalize.css?

Keep seo.js - should put it on every page?

Create an image.js for the website banner - all the important images.
